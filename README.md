Weeki web application
================================

Application
-------------------------

This application has been developped as a proof of concept for a MSc project at the University of Southampton. 
The app retrieves tweets corresponding to a Wikipedia article page, annotates them using the Wikipedia Miner wikification service, and integrates them on the page. 

Research project
-------------------------

The project has a larger scope, with more elaborate tweet retrieval, enrichment and integration steps. It also includes a review of the current research about information extraction from tweets.
