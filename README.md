Weeki web application
================================

Application
-------------------------

This application was developed as a proof of concept for a MSc project at the University of Southampton. 
The app retrieves tweets corresponding to a Wikipedia article page, annotates them using the Wikipedia Miner wikification service, and integrates them on the page. 
Installation: download the Play! framework, then type 'play' and 'run' in command line. Enter the url 'http://localhost:9000/wiki/Eurozone' for example to access an annotated versino of the Wikipedia Eurozone article (mobile).

Research project
-------------------------

The project has a larger scope, with more elaborate tweet retrieval, enrichment and integration steps. It also includes a review of the current research about information extraction from tweets.
